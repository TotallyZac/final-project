    <h1>Childhood</h1>
    <p>
      Judy was born on June 10th, 1922 in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Judy was just two and a half years old when she first performed on stage. She mentioned that being on stage was the only time she felt wanted. Her mother was for sure a stage mom. Judy was not a wanted child. As her parents were trying for an abortion which was illegal at the time. Judy and her family moved to California in 1926. That opened up more opportunities to Judy.

    <h1>Teenage Years</h1>
    <p>
      Judy was brought by her mother to many gigs. Her mother was constantly pushing her into numerous things. Her mother treated her very poorly. She would give Judy pills to make sure she would have energy and to sleep. Judy was not even 10 years old at the time. With Judy having a contract to MGM her appearance was quickly judged. She was put on extreme diets and was being told to take diet pills.

    <h3>Meet Me in St. Louis</h3>
    <p>"Meet Me in St. Louis" is a classic MGM romantic musical comedy that focuses on four sisters (one of whom is the nonpareil Judy Garland) on the cusp of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. The film spotlights the sisters' education in the ways of the world, which includes, but isn't limited to, learning about life and love, courtesy of the prototypical boy next door. In the end, love -- accompanied by song, dance and period costumes, all in glorious Technicolor -- conquers all.
